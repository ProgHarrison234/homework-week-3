# Secure Password Generator in Javascrpit
> In this project, I am working through javascript to create a secure password generator so that I can always be secure when creating a password and use a different password for each account. 

## Basics of the project
It is hard to come with a secure password for the inevitable account requirements for everything from Facebook to ones online banking. This password generator allows for a new and random password every time. By selecting a few criteria, the password generator can generate a password for your preferences or the account you are creatings needs. By using arrays and other functions, with a little bit of math, a new password is created just for you! Best part, none of the passwords are ever saved so they can not be seen by anyone but you during the time you generate the password.
